			<p><b>Tor</b> is one of the most well-known networks that protects the identity of both content providers and their clients against any tracking
or tracing on the Internet. So far, most research attention has been focused on investigating the security and privacy concerns of
Tor and characterizing the topic or hyperlink structure of its hidden services. However, there is still lack of knowledge about the
information leakage attributed to the linking from Tor hidden services to the surface Web. This work addresses this gap by presenting
a broad evaluation of the network of referencing from Tor to surface Web and investigates to what extent Tor hidden services are
vulnerable against this type of information leakage. The analyses also consider how linking to surface websites can change the overall
hyperlink structure of Tor hidden services. They also provide reports regarding the type of information and services provided by
Tor domains. Results recover the dark-to-surface network as a single massive connected component where over 90% of Tor hidden
services have at least one link to the surface world despite their interest in being isolated from surface Web tracking. We identify that
Tor directories have closest proximity to all other Web resources and signicantly contribute to both communication and information
dissemination through the network which emphasizes on the main application of Tor as information provider to the public. Our study
is the product of crawling near 2 million pages from 23,145 onion seed addresses, over a three-month period.</br>

			<p><b>Tor</b> is among most well-known <b>dark net</b> in the world. It has noble uses, including as a platform for free 
		speech and information dissemination under the guise of true anonymity, but may be culturally better known as 
		a conduit for criminal activity and as a platform to market illicit goods and data. Past studies on the 
		content of Tor support this notion, but were carried out by targeting popular domains likely to contain 
		illicit content. A survey of past studies may thus not yield a complete evaluation of the content and use of 
		Tor. <b>This work</b> addresses this gap by presenting a broad evaluation of the content of the English Tor ecosystem. 
		We perform a comprehensive crawl of the Tor dark web and, through topic and network analysis, characterize 
		the `types' of information and services hosted across a broad swath of Tor domains and their hyperlink relational 
		structure. We recover nine domain types defined by the information or service they host and, among other findings, 
		unveil how some types of domains intentionally silo themselves from the rest of Tor. We also present measurements 
		that (regrettably) suggest how marketplaces of illegal drugs and services do emerge as the dominant type of Tor 
				domain. Our study is the product of crawling over <b>1 million</b> pages from 20,000 Tor seed addresses, yielding a 
		collection of over 150,000 Tor pages. </br>

		<h3 align="center"> Enhancing Phishing attack detection </h3>
			<p><b>Phishing</b> as one of the most well-known <b>cybercrime activities</b> is a deception of online users to steal their 
		personal or confidential information by impersonating a legitimate website. Several machine learning-based 
		strategies have been proposed to detect phishing websites. These techniques are dependent on the features 
		extracted from the website samples. However, few studies have actually considered efficient feature selection 
		for detecting phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate an agreement on the definitive features which 
		should be used in phishing detection. We apply Fuzzy Rough Set (FRS) theory as a tool to select <b>most effective 
		features</b> from three benchmarked data sets. The selected features are fed into three often used classifiers for 
		phishing detection. To evaluate the FRS feature selection in developing a generalizable phishing detection, 
		the classifiers are trained by a separate out-of-sample data set of 14,000 website samples.

		<p>Understanding the qualities of <b>Web robot traffic</b> is essential to build mechanisms for mitigating 
		the impact of their traffic on Web systems. This project presents an updated characterization of the 
		<b>navigational</b> and <b>session patterns</b> of Web robot traffic across three Web servers in the United States, 
		Europe, and the Middle East under 30 different features. The results indicate that some features may be 
		fitted to the same <b>heavy-tailed</b> model across the Web servers, but the best fitting models for other features 
		depend on the Web server. Due to some different tasks of Web robots and security policies set by website 
		administrators, there are thus some features of Web robot traffic that cannot be universally modeled.</br>

		<h3 align="center"> Feature selection based on Fuzzy Rough Set theory </h3>
		<p>Despite emerging of Web 2.0 applications and increasing requirements to well-behaved Web robots, malicious ones can reveal irreparable 
		risks for Web sites. Regardless of behavior of Web robots, they may occupy bandwidth and reduce performance of Web servers. 
		In spite of many prestigious researches trying to characterize Web visitors and classify them, there is a lack of concentration on
		feature selection to dynamically choose attributes used to describe Web sessions. Therefore, in this research, a new algorithm is 
		proposed based on Fuzzy Rough Set (RST) theory to better characterize and cluster Web visitors of three real Web sites. RST describes 
		how a collection of data may be separated based on a decision boundary and an indiscernibility relation (Pawlak, 1982).</br>

		<h3 align="center"> Comparing Neural Network and DBSCAN in clustering Web users</h3>
		<p>Today  world’s  dependence  on  the  Internet  and  the  emerging  of  Web  2.0 applications  significantly  increased  the requirement  of 
		web  robots  crawling the  sites  to  support  services  and  technologies.  Regardless  of  the  advantages of  robots,  
		they  may  occupy  the  bandwidth  and  reduce  the  performance  of web servers. Despite a variety of studies, there is no accurate method 
		for classifying  huge  data  sets  of  web  visitors  in  a  reasonable  amount  of  time. Moreover,  this  technique  should  be  insensitive 
		to  the  ordering  of  instances and  produce  deterministic  accurate  results.  Therefore,  in this research we present a density-based
		clustering  approach  using  Density-Based  Spatial  Clustering  of Applications with Noises (DBSCAN), to classify web visitors of two real 
		large data sets and compare its efficiency with the performance of Self-Organizing Map as a Neural Network technique. For more information about the results of this research,

		<p>The MCL algorithm (Van Dongen, 2001) is a powerful method to cluster data points by simulating stochastic flows over an input graph.
		MCL has seen success in a variety of domains, such as social network analysis, knowledge base enrichment, community detection, and bioinformatics.
		The MCL algorithm is specified by an M<sub>(k×k)</sub> column stochastic matrix, representing probabilities of transitions within a complete graph on k nodes. 
		Nodes of this graph correspond to a data point (i.e. a web session) while transition probabilities (specified by the matrix element m<sub>ij</sub>) 
		specify the strength of a relationship or the degree of similarity among them. MCL finds a clustering of nodes in the graph by transforming M with 
		iterative applications of three operations, namely expand, inflate, and prune, until a convergence criterion is reached.

		<h3 align="center"> Defining new navigational features to describe web crawlers </h3>
		<p>To describe web visitors, we suggest new features based on the behavioral patterns recorded in access log files of web servers. 
		For instance, Penalty is a numerical attribute proposed based
        on the navigational patterns of humans which involve a large number of frequent back-and-forward movements and loops. Having a view restricted by 
		the structure of links of a site to find the required information, “back” and “forward” option in web browser’s history and disorienting the humans 
		during their visits are some reasons that cause such navigational patterns. While after the first crawl of a site, robots can detect where the required information
        resides and restrict their next requests to specific areas of that site. Penalty attribute penalizes each back-and-forward navigation or loop, and it 
		is reasonable to expect a larger value for this attribute among human users than web robots. If interested, please refer to our paper,

		<h3 align="center"> Using Fuzzy Inference System based on decision trees for Web robot classification </h3>
		<p>Web administrators should pay special attention and closely inspect web sessions that correspond to web robots; 
		because  the  traffic  of  these  autonomous  systems  occupies  the  bandwidth,  reduces  the  performance  of  web servers  and  in  some  cases, 
		threaten  the  security  of  human  users.  In  this  research, we  propose  a  novel  fuzzy algorithm based on the decision trees. 
		In order to overcome the curse of dimensionality issue and facilitate the designing of the fuzzy inference system, 
		we use a correlation analysis to eliminate some features. For converting each  filtered  attribute  to  a  fuzzy  variable,  
		a  C4.5  decision  tree  is  used.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  making  a decision  tree  is  based  on  choosing  the  best  feature  
		with  the  most  information  gain  metric  in  each  level  of the tree.  Therefore,  we  can  reduce  the  number  of  attributes  again.  Finally, 
		the fuzzy  rules  are  extracted  from  the  C4.5 decision tree and the fuzzy inference model is made. </p></td></tr>
