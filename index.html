		<h3 align="left"> Web traffic characterization </h3>
		<p>Understanding the qualities of Web robot traffic is essential to build mechanisms for mitigating the impact of their traffic on Web systems. This project presents an updated 
		characterization of the navigational and session patterns of Web robot traffic across three Web servers in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East under 30 different features. The
results indicate that some features may be fitted to the same heavy-tailed model across the Web servers, but the best fitting models for other features depend on the Web server. Due to some different
tasks of Web robots and security policies set by website administrators, there are thus some features of Web robot traffic that cannot be universally modeled. The paper titled <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8362266/?part=1"> 
“Some (Non-)Universal Features of Web Robot Traffic” </a> which presents the report of this project has been accepted at <a href= "http://ee-ciss.princeton.edu/"> 52th Annual
Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)</a>.

		<h3 align="left"> Feature selection based on Fuzzy Rough Set theory </h3>
		<p>Despite emerging of Web 2.0 applications and increasing requirements to well-behaved Web robots, malicious ones can reveal irreparable 
		risks for Web sites. Regardless of behavior of Web robots, they may occupy bandwidth and reduce performance of Web servers. 
		In spite of many prestigious researches trying to characterize Web visitors and classify them, there is a lack of concentration on
		feature selection to dynamically choose attributes used to describe Web sessions. Therefore, in this research, a new algorithm is 
		proposed based on Fuzzy Rough Set (RST) theory to better characterize and cluster Web visitors of three real Web sites. RST describes 
		how a collection of data may be separated based on a decision boundary and an indiscernibility relation (Pawlak, 1982).The report of this research
		is resulted in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417304116?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BjJ7RLNelTyudIJyk8OG4Lg%3D%3D">

		<h3 align="left"> Comparing Neural Network and DBSCAN in clustering Web users</h3>
		<p>Today  world’s  dependence  on  the  Internet  and  the  emerging  of  Web  2.0 applications  significantly  increased  the requirement  of 
		web  robots  crawling the  sites  to  support  services  and  technologies.  Regardless  of  the  advantages of  robots,  
		they  may  occupy  the  bandwidth  and  reduce  the  performance  of web servers. Despite a variety of studies, there is no accurate method 
		for classifying  huge  data  sets  of  web  visitors  in  a  reasonable  amount  of  time. Moreover,  this  technique  should  be  insensitive 
		to  the  ordering  of  instances and  produce  deterministic  accurate  results.  Therefore,  in this research we present a density-based
		clustering  approach  using  Density-Based  Spatial  Clustering  of Applications with Noises (DBSCAN), to classify web visitors of two real 
		large data sets and compare its efficiency with the performance of Self-Organizing Map as a Neural Network technique. For more information about the results of this research,
		please refer to <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-016-2476-4?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BjJ7RLNelTyudIJyk8OG4Lg%3D%3D">

		<h3 align="left"> Using Markov Clustering for Web robot detection </h3>
		<p>The MCL algorithm (Van Dongen, 2001) is a powerful method to cluster data points by simulating stochastic flows over an input graph.
		MCL has seen success in a variety of domains, such as social network analysis, knowledge base enrichment, community detection, and bioinformatics.
		The MCL algorithm is specified by an M<sub>(k×k)</sub> column stochastic matrix, representing probabilities of transitions within a complete graph on k nodes. 
		Nodes of this graph correspond to a data point (i.e. a web session) while transition probabilities (specified by the matrix element m<sub>ij</sub>) 
		specify the strength of a relationship or the degree of similarity among them. MCL finds a clustering of nodes in the graph by transforming M with 
		iterative applications of three operations, namely expand, inflate, and prune, until a convergence criterion is reached.

		<h3 align="left"> Defining new navigational features to describe web crawlers </h3>
		<p>To describe web visitors, we suggest new features based on the behavioral patterns recorded in access log files of web servers. 
		For instance, Penalty is a numerical attribute proposed based
        on the navigational patterns of humans which involve a large number of frequent back-and-forward movements and loops. Having a view restricted by 
		the structure of links of a site to find the required information, “back” and “forward” option in web browser’s history and disorienting the humans 
		during their visits are some reasons that cause such navigational patterns. While after the first crawl of a site, robots can detect where the required information
        resides and restrict their next requests to specific areas of that site. Penalty attribute penalizes each back-and-forward navigation or loop, and it 
		is reasonable to expect a larger value for this attribute among human users than web robots. If interested, please refer to our paper,

		<h3 align="left"> Using Fuzzy Inference System based on decision trees for Web robot classification </h3>
		<p>Web administrators should pay special attention and closely inspect web sessions that correspond to web robots; 
		because  the  traffic  of  these  autonomous  systems  occupies  the  bandwidth,  reduces  the  performance  of  web servers  and  in  some  cases, 
		threaten  the  security  of  human  users.  In  this  research, we  propose  a  novel  fuzzy algorithm based on the decision trees. 
		In order to overcome the curse of dimensionality issue and facilitate the designing of the fuzzy inference system, 
		we use a correlation analysis to eliminate some features. For converting each  filtered  attribute  to  a  fuzzy  variable,  
		a  C4.5  decision  tree  is  used.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  making  a decision  tree  is  based  on  choosing  the  best  feature  
		with  the  most  information  gain  metric  in  each  level  of the tree.  Therefore,  we  can  reduce  the  number  of  attributes  again.  Finally, 
		the fuzzy  rules  are  extracted  from  the  C4.5 decision tree and the fuzzy inference model is made. </p></td></tr>
